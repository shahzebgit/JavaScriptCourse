    <h1>Coding Challenge 1!!</h1>
    <h2>
        Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI =
        mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter). <br>
        <br>
            1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables <br>
            2. Calculate both their BMIs <br>
            3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.<br>
            4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than
            John's? true").<br>
